# React + Markdown

As part of this project now I needed how to pull markdown from a external source and parse it to HTML via React, there are many alternatives to do this, like fetch + showdown, to things very sophisticated like MDX that uses markdown withing JSX files, creating a whole new format, for now I will try to use fetch and react-markdown.

more to come...
